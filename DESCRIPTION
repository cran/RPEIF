Description: Computes the influence functions time series of the returns for the risk and 
             performance measures as mentioned in Chen and Martin (2018) 
             <https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3085672>, as well as in Zhang et al. (2019)
             <https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3415903>. Also evaluates estimators influence
             functions at a set of parameter values and plots them to display the shapes of 
             the influence functions.
